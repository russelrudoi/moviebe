# MovieBE - site to find your favorite movie or TV series

It's my study project for finding movies, TV series, and keeping up with new films.

## What is it doing? 

On the site, you can follow both new movies and TV series and those that are already in theaters.

Click on the movie you like and you will be taken to its page. On the page, you will see information about the movie, stills from the movie, and the trailer. If you like this movie, you can check out similar movies at the bottom of the page.

## The technologies used here

The site is adapted for phones and computers.

The site is built on React with Redux.
